# OptiNetSim-backend

**Please note that this project is currently under development and some features may not be fully implemented yet.**

**OptiNetSim** is a optical network simulation platform that allows users to design, analyze, and optimize optical network topologies. It leverages the GNPY library for physical layer simulations and provides a comprehensive set of features for network design and analysis.

### Key Features

* **User Authentication**: Secure login, registration, and account management.
* **Network Topology Management**: Create, read, update, and delete optical network topologies.
* **Node and Connection Management**: Add, edit, and delete nodes and connections within a network.
* **Equipment Library Management**: Manage custom equipment libraries with various component types.
* **Simulation and Analysis**: Run simulations using GNPY and analyze network performance.
* **Service and Traffic Management**: Define service requirements and traffic constraints.
* **Import/Export**: Import and export network topologies and equipment libraries in JSON format.

### Technology Stack

* **Backend**: Python with Flask framework
* **Database**: MongoDB
* **Simulation Library**: GNPY
